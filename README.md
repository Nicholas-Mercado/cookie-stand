Another big day! Was able to fix the nested for loop to propagate the hourly totals across all stores.
Spent the rest of the day working on styling and practicing flexbox.

#### __Reflections and Comments__

Wow. What a journey this week has been. Looking back I can not believe how much I have learned. Spent the day making some final touches to the css and making sure everything worked. Did not do a great job at updating my readme file every day so I went back and added some resources I used though out.
