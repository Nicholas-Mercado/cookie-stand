Big day. Really learned a lot. Going to have to spend more time on connecting my js to sales page to flush out my holes.

Another big day! Was able to fix the nested for loop to propagate the hourly totals across all stores.
Spent the rest of the day working on styling and practicing flexbox.

Nice day connecting my form to my constructor. Did some styling in css and I defiantly need some practice.
